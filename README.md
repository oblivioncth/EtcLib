# WIP

Not finished polishing, but:

Basically just a fork of etc2comp, taken from the version contained within [kram](https://github.com/alecazam/kram), which itself was forked from the [original](https://github.com/google/etc2comp).
This version is not functionally different from the `kram` version, but has completely revamped CMake scripts that make it easier to build cross-platform and include as a sub-project, either diretly or via CMake's ExternalProject and FetchContent mechanisms.

Look at my fork of [libsquish](https://github.com/oblivioncth/libsquish) as this is setup the same way in terms of its CMake packaging, just with different names.

I will finish documenting this at some point.
