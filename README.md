# WIP

Not finished polishing, but:

Basically just a fork of etc2comp, taken from the version contained within [kram](https://github.com/alecazam/kram), which itself was forked from the [original](https://github.com/google/etc2comp).
This version is not functionally different from the `kram` version, but has completely revamped CMake scripts that make it easier to build cross-platform and include as a sub-project, either diretly or via CMake's ExternalProject and FetchContent mechanisms.
